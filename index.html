<p>Hate crimes committed by white offenders rose significantly after 2016 according to data collected from the U.S. Department of Justice. Many sources suspect this is due to Trump’s election, which marked a time of great divide in the country. </p>

<p>Data is collected by the U.S. Department of Justice based on the FBI’s definition of a hate crime, which is a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” </p>


<p>It has been estimated that hate crimes committed by white offenders rose by over 830 in the two-year span of 2016-2018 and continued to rise from 2018-2019, though much less dramatically. 2019 currently marks the highest number of reported crimes since 2015. </p>

<p>According to an article from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/03/23/hate-crimes-rose-the-day-after-trump-was-elected-fbi-data-show">The Washington Post</a>, three white men from Kansas were arrested after intending to bomb a Mosque the day after Trump’s election. The article also states that hate crimes tend to increase after infamous events, like terrorist attacks for example. This is extremely relevant here, as an article from CNN stated that there were a reported 867 cases of harassment in the first 10 days after the election. </p> 

<p>However, cases have remained high since the election, reflecting an upward trend rather than a response to an isolated incident. Many connect this to the remainder of Trump’s presidency, as his divisive and controversial language has been said to downplay the prominence of white nationalism. </p>

<p>According to PolitiFact, Sen. Amy Klobuchar said very vaguely that <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/03/hate-crimes-are-increasingly-reported-us">“there has been an increase in hate crimes.”</a> In the same CNN interview, she mentioned that the 2019 Christchurch shooter said Trump “renewed white identity.” </p> 

<p>The belief that Trump’s election was a major cause of an uptick in hate crimes is not unfounded, as the former president has been known for making offensive comments about marginalized groups. For example, a Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history">article</a>  recalled how he started his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” who bring crime and drugs to the country. </p>

<p>He also said to potential black voters, “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?” </p>


<p>As seen in the pie chart, race, ethnicity, and ancestry accounted for a hefty 65.1% of all hate crimes committed by white offenders in 2019. This is followed by sexual orientation at 14.15%, and religion at 12.7%. </p>  

<p>Since 2015, African Americans have been the most common target for white offenders. The third chart shows the six groups most commonly victimized by white offenders from 2015-2019. Most groups have seen an increase, however, the number of hate crimes committed against African Americans is marginally higher by about one thousand. </p>

<p>According to Michael E. Miller from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/12/27/war-races-how-hateful-ideology-echoes-through-american-history">The Washington Post</a>, this is most likely due to the U.S.’ history of slavery and white supremacists’ belief that a race war has been occurring for centuries. They fear that there exists an urgent threat of whites being “wiped out.” The 2019 article also states that white supremacy has increased dramatically in the past five years, and the effects of this are clearly visible in the first graph.   
 </p> 

 <p>It must also be noted that it is optional for law enforcement to send their crime data to the FBI, meaning the total number of hate crimes that actually occur are most likely much higher than what the data reflects. This is especially concerning given the recent protests against police brutality. </p>  


 <p>When looking at the trajectory of total hate crimes, as in offenders of all races and ethnicities, there is an increase of about 1,700 from 2015-2019. As seen in the last chart, the spike from 2016-2017 accounts for about two-thirds of the total increase. For both white offenders and the country as a whole, 2016 was a pivotal year for spikes in hate crimes. 
</p>

<p>With the coming of Covid-19, hate crimes have continued to rise, largely against those of Asian descent. This increase was caused by those who unfairly blamed Asian Americans for the outbreak, in many cases leading to physical violence. Additionally, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/fbi-says-hate-crimes-against-asian-and-black-people-rise-in-the-us.html">crimes targeting African Americans</a> have risen 40% from the previous year. Based on the data collected after 2019, it can be expected for the upward trend to continue. </p>  
 
 <p>In response to this, President Joe Biden signed the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, which aims to address hate crimes over the course of the pandemic. The act has an emphasis on crimes targeting Asian Americans specifically. </p>

<p>The act requires the Department of Justice to establish an online hate crime reporting process and improve its education campaigns. It also provides state grants in order to start hotlines for victims. </p>

<p>It is currently too early to tell how effective Biden’s Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act will be, however, it is a step in the right direction. Despite this, hate crimes have continued to rise since 2019, and right now it’s unclear if or when they will ever go back down.
